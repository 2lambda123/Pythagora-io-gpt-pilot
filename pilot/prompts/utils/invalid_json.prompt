[INST]I received an invalid JSON response. The response was a parseable JSON object, but it is not valid against the schema I provided. The JSON is invalid {{ invalid_reason }}

Please try again with a valid JSON object which conforms to the JSON schema I provided above. Note that the schema is NOT an example of what the response should look like, but a set of guidelines on how to construct your response.

A response which starts with "I'm sorry for the confusion" would be an example of an invalid response, a preamble must NOT be included.
