I want you to {% if readme %}update the{% else %}create a{% endif %} `README.md` for this {{ app_type }} "{{ name }}".

{{ project_description }}

Here are the technologies that are used in this project:
```
{% for tech in technologies %}
- {{ tech }}
{% endfor %}
```

The README should be based on the README.md Template below, you should not leave any section empty, but you may omit sections that are not applicable to this project. You can add more sections if you think they are necessary.
Once you use the function `write_files` I will assume that you have finished updating the documentation.

{% if readme %}
The current README.md file is as follows:

```
{{ readme }}
```
{% else %}
There is currently no README.md file in the project workspace. Do not ask to read it using the `get_files` function.
{% endif %}

{%- if directory_structure %}
You can use the function `get_files` as many times as you want to read files that may be of interest, each time you call `get_files` I will add the contents of the file to the conversation context.

The directory structure of the project is as follows:

```
{{ directory_structure }}
```
{% else %}
There a currently no files in the project workspace.
{% endif %}
