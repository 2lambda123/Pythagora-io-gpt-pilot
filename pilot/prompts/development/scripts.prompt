This project uses the following technologies:
```
{% for tech in technologies %}
- {{ tech }}
{% endfor %}
```

{% if directory_structure -%}
The directory structure of the project is as follows:

```
{{ directory_structure }}
```
{%- else %}
There a currently no files in the project workspace.
{%- endif %}

I want you to ensure that the following files are created for this {{ app_type }} and ready for use by developers.

- .editorconfig - should have the standard settings for the languages
- .gitignore
- scripts/: lint, test, build, start, deploy, get_dependencies
- .github/workflows/: ci.yml, deploy.yml

All of the scripts should be able to be run from Windows, Mac, and Linux.
If the project is based on a scripting language, then the the scripts should be written using the same language, otherwise for each script provide a bash script for Mac & Linux and a batch script for Windows.

The `get_dependencies` script should parse the project's build/dependency file (package.json, requirements.txt, build.gradle etc) and write all of the dependencies with version information to stdout.

You can use the function `get_files` as many times as you want to read files that may be of interest, each time you call `get_files` I will add the contents of the file to the conversation context.
Once you use the function `write_files` I will assume that you have finished updating the documentation.
