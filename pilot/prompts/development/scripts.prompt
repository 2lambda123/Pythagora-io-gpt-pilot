This project uses the following technologies:
```
{% for tech in technologies %}
- {{ tech }}
{% endfor %}
```

{% if directory_structure -%}
The directory structure of the project is as follows:

```
{{ directory_tree }}
```
{%- else %}
There a currently no files in the project workspace.
{%- endif %}

I want you to ensure that the following files are created for this {{ app_type }} and ready for use by developers.

- .editorconfig - should have the standard settings for the languages
- .gitignore - ignore build & test artifacts, IDE files (IntelliJ, VS Code)...
- scripts/: lint, test, build, start, deploy
- .gpt-pilot/get_dependencies.py
- .github/workflows/: ci.yml, deploy.yml


A pre-commit hook should be configured to run lint and test. If the project has a `package.json`, ensure that the pre-commit `pre-commit` dependency is installed and configured, otherwise configure the hook using the `pre-commit` package from pip.

The `.gpt-pilot/get_dependencies.py` script should parse the project's build/dependency file (package.json, requirements.txt, build.gradle etc) and write all of the dependencies with version information to stdout.

For Mac, and Linux provide implement the scripts in bash, for Windows provide an equivalent batch file for each script.

You can use the function `get_files` as many times as you want to read files that may be of interest, each time you call `get_files` I will add the contents of the file to the conversation context.
Once you use the function `write_files` I will assume that you have finished updating the documentation.
