This project uses the following technologies:
```
{% for tech in technologies %}
- {{ tech }}
{% endfor %}
```

{% if directory_structure -%}
The directory structure of the project is as follows:

```
{{ directory_tree }}
```
{%- else %}
There a currently no files in the project workspace.
{%- endif %}

I want you to ensure that the following files are created for this {{ app_type }} and ready for use by developers.

- .editorconfig - should have the standard settings for the languages
- .gitignore - ignore build & test artifacts, IDE files (IntelliJ, VS Code)...
- scripts/: lint, test, build, start, deploy, get_dependencies
- .github/workflows/: ci.yml, deploy.yml


A pre-commit hook should be configured to run lint and test. If the project has a `package.json`, ensure that the pre-commit `pre-commit` dependency is installed and configured, otherwise configure the hook using the `pre-commit` package from pip.

For Mac, and Linux provide implement the scripts in bash, for Windows provide an equivalent batch file for each script.

The `get_dependencies` script should parse the project's build/dependency file (package.json, requirements.txt, build.gradle etc) and write all of the dependencies with version information to stdout.

You can use the function `get_files` as many times as you want to read files that may be of interest, each time you call `get_files` I will add the contents of the file to the conversation context.
Once you use the function `write_files` I will assume that you have finished updating the documentation.
