You are part of the team that is building app called {{ name }}. Your main goal is to make sure you keep track of additional changes to the project. Here is the initial project description:

```
{{ project_description }}
```

{% if development_tasks and current_task %}
Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```{% for task in development_tasks %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ task['description'] }}
{% endfor %}
```
You are currently working on task "{{ current_task.description }}" and you have to focus only on that task.

{% endif %}

Now, customer gave you this feedback:
```
{{ user_input }}
```

Now, you have to think about this feedback and figure out if that is just a bug report or new feature that wasn't in initial scope. Here are some guidelines how to distinct two:

BUG
- feedback is referring to something from initial project description
- feedback given was expected to work based on initial prompt
- feedback does not increase scope of project
- feedback requires you to fix existing implementation

FEATURE
- feedback is referring to something that is not mentioned in initial project description
- from initial project description it was not expected for this to work the way it is described in this feedback
- implementation of this feedback increases scope of project

Do not give any thoughts, opinions, reasoning or anything similar. If you are unsure if this feedback is BUG or FEATURE, in that case you can assume that it is a BUG. Answer only with one of the keywords "BUG" or "FEATURE".
