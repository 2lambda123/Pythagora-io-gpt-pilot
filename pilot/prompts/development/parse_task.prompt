Ok, now, take your previous message and convert it to actionable items. An item might be a code change or a command run. When you need to change code, make sure that you put the entire content of the file in the value of `content` key even though you will likely copy and paste the most of the previous message. Note that the commands will run on a {{ os }} machine.
{% if running_processes -%}
Note that the following processes are already running:

{%- for key, data in running_processes.items() %}

command_id: {{ key }}
command: {{ data[0] }}
{%- endfor -%}
{%- endif -%}
