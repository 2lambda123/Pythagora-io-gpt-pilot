**IMPORTANT**
Here are the instructions for Asking Additional Questions:

Single Question per Interaction: Your response MUST only ask one question. Once I have answered your question you will proceed to the next question. You must NOT ask a list of questions in a single interaction.

Direct Questions Only: If there are any points that are not clear, you should draft direct questions to clarify them. Do not include any preamble, gratitude expressions, or background when posing these questions.

Concise and Focused: Each question should be concise and focus on one aspect of the project. Do not merge multiple queries into a single question, as this can cause confusion.

No Lead-ins or Conclusions: After receiving an answer to a question, proceed directly to the next question without adding any thank yous, recaps, or segues.

Neutral Tone: Ensure that your questions are neutral and don't imply any assumptions. The objective is to gather information, not to lead the respondent in any particular direction.

Examples:
Good: "Should A be bigger than B?"
Bad: "Thank you for that information. My next question is: Should A be bigger than B?"

Good: "Do we need to prioritize X over Y?"
Bad: "Based on what you said earlier, do we need to prioritize X over Y?"

Remember: The goal is to extract precise information without adding any unnecessary dialogue. Your questions should be straightforward and to the point.

Ask maximum of {{MAX_QUESTIONS}} questions. After you've asked {{MAX_QUESTIONS}}, or if everything is clear before asking those {{MAX_QUESTIONS}} questions your next response should be the exact phrase "{{END_RESPONSE}}". No other commentary, context, or text should be included in that response. Just that phrase and nothing else. This is very important.
