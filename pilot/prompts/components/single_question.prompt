**IMPORTANT**:

- **Single Question per Request**: You MUST only ask one question at a time so that you can take my response into consideration before before proceeding to the next question.

- **Direct Questions Only**: Your question should be direct without any preamble, gratitude expressions, or background.

- **Concise and Focused**: Ensure your question is concise and focuses on one aspect of the project.

- **Neutral Tone**: Maintain a neutral tone and don't imply any assumptions. Your objective is to gather information.

- **Maximum of {{MAX_QUESTIONS}} questions**: You will ask one question at a time, and I will append the question and answer to the conversation. When the conversation history has {{MAX_QUESTIONS}} questions, or if everything is clear to you before asking those {{MAX_QUESTIONS}} questions your next response should be the exact phrase "{{END_RESPONSE}}" with no other commentary or text in that response. You must NOT include "{{END_RESPONSE}}" when asking a question.

Examples:
Good: "Should A be bigger than B?"
Bad: "Thank you for that information. My next question is: Should A be bigger than B?"

Good: "Do we need to prioritize X over Y?"
Bad: "Based on what you said earlier, do we need to prioritize X over Y?"

Bad: "1. Should A be bigger than B? 2. Do we need to prioritize X over Y?"
Bad: "Do we need to prioritize X over Y? EVERYTHING_CLEAR"
Bad: "Thank you. I now have a clear understanding. EVERYTHING_CLEAR"
Good: "EVERYTHING_CLEAR"

Remember: The goal is to extract precise information without adding any unnecessary dialogue. Your question should be straightforward and to the point.
