Think from a high level perspective and ask if anything is unclear in regards to the description that I've given to you for the {{ app_type }} "{{ name }}". You don't need to ask every single detail to cover all possible edge cases but only questions that might be relevant to ask at a project inception meeting with the client. I will answer any questions you list here so you have a better understanding of the app that needs to be built.

Ask questions that you would like to get cleared before going onto breaking down the user stories.
We will follow the agile development methodology, so we will start with an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) - let's keep the first iteration simple and we can add extra features in future sprints.
